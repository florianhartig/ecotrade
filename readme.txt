This repository contains the model code used for the publications: 

Florian Hartig & Martin Drechsler (2009): Smart spatial incentives for market-based conservation. [Biol. Conserv. 142, 779-788.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2009.07.001)

Florian Hartig & Martin Drechsler (2010): Stay by thy neighbor? Social organization determines the efficiency of biodiversity markets with spatial incentives. [Ecol. Complex. 7, 91-99.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2008.12.014)

Note: this is the final snapshot from a previous subversion repository, which I have not converted to git. The code corresponds qualitatively to what was used in the papers. If you are interested in an 100% exact replication, you should probably request the original svn repo from me, which should have tags for the model versions used for the respective publications.
